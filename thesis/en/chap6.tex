\chapter{Adapters}

If the polygon mesh does not satisfy the designed concept of the algorithm then the compiler
raises an error. Nevertheless, in some cases, there is an option to create an additional function
that performs according the requirements for the absent operation.
In C++ standard library, adapters are used to build function objects out of ordinary
functions or class methods.\cite{Simonis2000}
In this chapter is described the purpose of adapters in the implementation of generic algorithms
supported by several examples. It is primarily used in case of absence any required operation
used in algorithm.

\section{Usage}

Same as algorithms, adaptors have specific requirements to be created.
