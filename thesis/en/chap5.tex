\chapter{Algorithms Decomposition}

In this chapter are decomposed the algorithms (see chapter \ref{chap:op_al}) so that basic
operations over polygon
mesh can be summarized. The word ``\emph{basic}" is relative according the chosen level.
In this thesis is chosen such level that leads to the least count of operations in total.\\
\\
If the mesh does not fulfill the concept of the algorithm \emph{adaptors} can be used instead
of the absent operators. An adaptor behaves like an operator but in fact it is the algorithm that
makes a desired step as a result. In the other words it is the operator implemented in terms
brute-force. In some cases, lack of an operator can not be replaced by an adaptor.
